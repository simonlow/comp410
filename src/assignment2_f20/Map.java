/* Behavior: A Map will provide this collection of operations:

  put: 
    in: a string (the key) and a Value object (associated with the key)
    return: a Value object, or null
    effect: 
      if key is NOT in the structure
         add a new cell to the structure and put the key into it, the value into it
         and return null
      if key IS in the structure
         do not add a new cell
         instead, replace the Value object in the existing cell
                  with the new Value object
                  return the old Value object (the one being replaced)

  get: 
    in: a string (the key) 
    return: a Value object, or null
    effect: 
      if key is NOT in the structure
         return null (this includes when the structure is empty, size 0)
      if key IS in the structure
         return the Value object from the cell containing the key

  remove: 
    in: a string (the key of the pair to be removed)
    return: nothing in all cases (return void)
    effect: 
      if the key IS in the structure
        take the whole cell out of the structure... the (key,value) pair will not be in the
        structure after
      if the key is NOT in the structure
        make no changes to the state of the structure 
     
  hasKey: 
    in: a string (the key)
    return: boolean
    effect: 
      if key IS in the structure (meaning there is a (key,value) pair for the key), 
        return true
      if key is NOT in the structure, return false
      in both cases, no change to the structure tate 

  size:
    in: nothing
    return: int, the number of (key,value) pairs stored in the map structure
    effect: no change to state of tree nodes
