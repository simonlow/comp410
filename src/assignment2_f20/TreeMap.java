/* Behavior: A TreeMap will provide Map operations, and also these:

  minKey: 
    in: none
    return: string, the key from the tree that is smallest
    effect: no tree state change
      if tree size if 0, return null

  maxKey: 
    in: none
    return: string, the key from the tree that is largest
    effect: no tree state change
      if tree size if 0, return null

  getKeys 
    in: nothing
    return: an array of strings, containing just the keys from the tree cells
    effect: the array of strings is produced in alphabetic order, small to large
      note, this means do an in-order traversal to get the keys out of the BST sorted
